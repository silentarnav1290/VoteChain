The Create NFT button will create a unique NFT id which should then be put in the input box corresponding to NFT ID on the GUI
The NFT ID will be created in the order of increasing whole numbers (starting from 1)
Then the send NFT button will send the NFT to the candidate wallet 
this whole process can be seen through Count NFT button
